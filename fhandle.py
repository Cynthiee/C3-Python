# In Python's zen, simplicity thrives,

# In clarity, our minds can steep.
# Sparse is better than dense and crowded,
# In clean design, our thoughts unshrouded.

# Readability counts, so clear and plain,
# Let your code speak, like a gentle rain.
# Explicit is better than implicit,
# In Python's zen, it's always implicit.

# Errors should never pass in silence,
# Raise exceptions, with guidance.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the urge to guess,
# Explicit is better than implicit, no less.

# Simple tasks should be easy and clear,
# Complex tasks, perhaps not so near.
# Now is better than never, start today,
# In the zen of Python, we find our way.
