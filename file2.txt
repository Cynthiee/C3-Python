In Python's zen, simplicity thrives,
In every line, the code derives.
Readability, a virtue sought,
Complexity, a foe, we fought.

Flat is better than nested deep,
In clarity, our minds can steep.
Sparse is better than dense and crowded,
In clean design, our thoughts unshrouded.

Readability counts, so clear and plain,
Let your code speak, like a gentle rain.
Explicit is better than implicit,
In Python's zen, it's always implicit.

Errors should never pass in silence,
Raise exceptions, with guidance.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the urge to guess,
Explicit is better than implicit, no less.

Simple tasks should be easy and clear,
Complex tasks, perhaps not so near.
Now is better than never, start today,
In the zen of Python, we find our way.
